\brief This file contains the methods needed to implement the RTCounter functionalities.

Notes:   
        1.  If you are interested in testing how this driver performs when 
            the counter overflows we recommend you change this to 65500, which will make the 
            counter start in range of the overflow, saving loads of time. Overflows are implemented
            as a rebase of absolute times so you may want to take time to understand this first.

        2.  The ISR assumes the callback completes before the next timer tick. We only increment the 
            overflow counter on every interrupt
